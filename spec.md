# Webserver 2.0 specificiation

ðŸš§ this is a work in process! It relies on technologies not yet released. 

This specification document is designed to help organize thoughts as much as possible prior to starting software.

# Motivation

Casserole has had a large amount of success using a rio-based webserver environment to allow the software team to specify points where data needs to be read or written, and propagate that data to any client device which supports web browsing.

The current infrastructure has some threading-based issues, is entirely custom, and relies on a (fairly) convoluted data server mechanism to provide data in a queue format. Though field-proven, it has a number of flaws (including client-induced crashes, using strings as GUID's, duplicated logic on server and client side, incomplete deployment to driver view.... the list goes on).

[Network Tables V4](https://github.com/PeterJohnson/allwpilib/blob/nt4/ntcore/doc/networktables4.adoc) covers the main functionality our custom data server was implemented to accomplish, and is therefor provides a convenient point for us to rework our web interface around more standardized toolsets.

# Basic Specifications

## Server

Jetty shall be retained as the http server. Unneeded libraries (eg websockets and json processing) should be removed if not needed. Update all libraries to latest version.

## Transport Layer

NT4 is the chosen transport mechanism.

## Java Code Interface

### Signal

Signals are objects which track time-varying values inside robot code.

A variable may be annotated into a signal. The annotation should support user-defined custom namees and units, though it will default to deriving a name from the class structure (and default to an empty string for units).

Signals should cause two things to happen:

1) A specific entry in NT with the name, units, and value
2) A column in local .csv log files

Log file capture should happen the same way as it does today: methods are exposed to the user to indicate the start of teleop or autnonomous, or close the log out in disabled.

All signals should show up under a NT topic called `Signals`, so clients can find all possible signals with ease.

The server does not need to watch for value changes on either the name or units topics. Additionally, it does not need to scan for new signals being created by other clients.

### Calibration

Calibratinos are objects which represent values which are technically "constants" in software, but may be occassionally tuned by client programs. Timeouts and PID constants are common examples.

A variable may be annotated into a calibration. The annotation shoudl support user-defined custom name, units, min, and max. It should default to a name derived from the class structure, no units, and no range limits. The variable's value at annotation evaluation time may be used as the default value.

All calibrations should be first published under the topic `Calibrations`, so client programs can find them all easily. Client programs should only update the vlaue of existing calibrations, not attempt to create new ones themselves.

The server must watch all calibrations for changes to values and update the annotated variable.

MAYBE: The calibratino object should also be avaialble as a public class for the user to create, and register a callback function for consuming the new value?

NOTE: The save-to-file functionality has been removed from scope.

## Client Content

Clients will be presented a similar set of pages to what is displayed today.

### Index Page

Should have links to all other pages, and basic info about the build and deploy to help uniquely (as much as possible at least) identify what software is running.

### Plots

### Dashboard

This page is an alternate way to view specific values, presented in a formant easily viewable in a during-match environment. Only a small number of signals will be present, and should prioritize getting info as fast as possible. 

In user code, widgets get defined at init time, and users have the ability to change their displayed values.

This shoudl create a special `dashboard` topic in NT with enough info to describe the physical apperance and values of each widget.

The following "widgets" are allowed for displaying information:

#### Gauge

Configurable min acceptable, max acceptable.

Display shoudl show title, typed out value, and color-coding to indicate if the value is in the 'acceptable" range.

#### Boolean Indicator

light, turns on and off.

Color coded, allow for red/green/yellow 

#### Text Widget

has a title, and displays arbitrary text. 

#### Autonomous Chooser

NT entry listing all possible autonomous modes (name + index). Additional entries for "desired" and "selected". Clients manipulate "desired" and confirm the server's got it via "selected".

Server should be able to reuturn the selected autonomous mode to the user.

#### Cameras

Should be able to full-screen. Should be able to select from CameraServer reference to mjpg url.

### Signals

This is mostly a quick-debug view. It should display a flat, alphabetized list of all signals, filterable, with name, units, and value displayed. It should get updated at a modest rate so as to not bog down network traffic - 100ms maybe to start.

Its main purpose is to provide developers an at-a-glance way to see signal values. 

Its value is debatable - outline viewer might also suit this well?

### Calibration

This page is a filterable table of all possible calibrations with name, units, min, max, and default listed out. Users should be allowed to enter a new value by typing it in, and hitting an "apply" button. A "Reset" button should revert to the default value. Changed values should be highlighted with a different color row.
